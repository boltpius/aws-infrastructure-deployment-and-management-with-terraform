# Project Summary

This project details the creation of an end-to-end infrastructure on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Terraform for Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The objective was to establish a scalable, secure, and automated architecture for my infrastructure "PIUS".
## Summary of Achievements:

I designed and implemented a comprehensive, end-to-end infrastructure solution on AWS using Terraform. This included seamlessly integrating various components such as VPC, subnets, security groups, load balancers, autoscaling groups, and DNS setup. By streamlining these components, the infrastructure operates cohesively as a unified system, ensuring efficient performance and scalability. Through Terraformâ€™s automation, I orchestrated this complex infrastructure deployment, enabling rapid and consistent provisioning while adhering to best practices and minimizing manual intervention.

## Steps and Explanations:

### 1. VPC Configuration:
- **Process:** 
  - Defined a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) using Terraform's `aws_vpc` resource.
- **Details:** 
  - Utilized specific CIDR blocks and default tenancy for the VPC.

### 2. Internet Gateway:
- **Process:** 
  - Created an internet gateway using `aws_internet_gateway` resource and attached it to the VPC.
- **Details:** 
  - This facilitated internet access for resources within the VPC.

### 3. Subnets Setup:
- **Process:** 
  - Established public and private subnets through `aws_subnet` resources across multiple availability zones.
- **Details:** 
  - Enabled high availability and resource segregation within the VPC.

### 4. Routing Configuration:
- **Process:** 
  - Configured route tables for public subnets to direct traffic to the internet gateway via `aws_route_table`.
- **Details:** 
  - Facilitated proper network traffic routing within the VPC.

### 5. Security Groups:
- **Process:** 
  - Defined comprehensive security rules using `aws_security_group` for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic.
- **Details:** 
  - Allowed specific inbound and outbound traffic based on defined protocols and ports.

### 6. Launch Template:
- **Process:** 
  - Created a launch template via `aws_launch_template` specifying configurations for EC2 instances.
- **Details:** 
  - Included specifications for instance type, image ID, key pair, and user data.

### 7. Autoscaling Group (ASG):
- **Process:** 
  - Configured an autoscaling group using `aws_autoscaling_group` to dynamically adjust EC2 instance capacity based on load metrics.
- **Details:** 
  - Set minimum and maximum instance sizes to ensure scalability.

### 8. SSL Certificate and DNS Setup:
- **Process:** 
  - Obtained an SSL certificate through ACM (`aws_acm_certificate`) and validated it via Route 53.
- **Details:** 
  - Ensured secure connections and validated domain ownership for SSL/TLS.

### 9. Application Load Balancer (ALB) Configuration:
- **Process:** 
  - Set up an ALB via `aws_lb` to distribute incoming traffic across instances within the ASG.
- **Details:** 
  - Ensured efficient load distribution and high availability.

### 10. HTTP to HTTPS Redirection:
- **Process:** 
  - Configured a listener within ALB to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS for enhanced security.
- **Details:** 
  - Ensured secure communication channels for incoming requests.

### 11. Route 53 DNS Record:
- **Process:** 
  - Created a Route 53 record aliasing the ALB for domain name resolution.
- **Details:** 
  - Provided a user-friendly domain name resolution for the infrastructure.

This infrastructure setup aims to provide a scalable, secure, and automated solution for the PIUS system on AWS. The use of Terraform allows for consistent and efficient infrastructure deployment and management.
